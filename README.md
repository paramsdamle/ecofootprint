# EcoFootprint

This application was built for the Google Solution Challenge 2021. It leverages Flutter and Dart to present an interactive app that allows users to calculate their ecological footprint and compare it with their friends. We were inspired to build this after noticing that there was no all-encompassing carbon footprint calculator app. Given a user's input such as how much they drive and what food they eat, this app will calculate the carbon footprint of the user for the year and suggest ways for the user to reduce their footprint. 

### To Use

Currently, EcoFootprint has not been released on an app store, but can be easily accessed via Android Studio. To use EcoFootprint, download and install Android Studio and Flutter. Inside Android studio, install the Flutter and Dart plugins. Additionally, go to the Android Virtual Devices window to setup a virtual device to use. Finally, open the virutal device and click the run button to run main.dart. Enjoy!

##### Troubleshooting

- Ensure Flutter sdk and Dart sdk locations are set in settings
- After sdk locations are set, try to build with Gradle
- Make sure Flutter is installed properly as shown [in this guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows "in this guide")
