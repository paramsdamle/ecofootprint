# EcoFootprint

This application was built for the Google Solution Challenge 2021. It leverages Flutter and Dart to present an interactive app that allows users to calculate their ecological footprint and compare it with their friends. We were inspired to build this after noticing that there was no all-encompassing carbon footprint calculator app. Given a user's input such as how much they drive and what food they eat, this app will calculate the carbon footprint of the user for the year and suggest ways for the user to reduce their footprint.
